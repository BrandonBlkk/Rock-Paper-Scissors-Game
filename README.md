# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This simple Python program allows users to play the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game against the computer.

## How the Game Works

The program prompts the user to input their choice (rock, paper, or scissors), and then randomly generates a choice for the computer. The game determines the winner based on the classic rules:

- Rock smashes scissors.
- Paper covers rock.
- Scissors cut paper.

The result of the game is then displayed, indicating whether the player wins, loses, or if it's a tie.

## Why It's Useful

This project is a fun and interactive way to practice basic Python programming skills. It's an excellent learning tool for beginners to understand user input, conditional statements, functions, and the use of randomization in programming.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BrandonBlkk/rock-paper-scissors.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd rock-paper-scissors
   ```

3. **Run the Game:**
   ```bash
   python RockPaperScissor.py
   ```

4. **Enter Your Choice:**
   - When prompted, enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors).

5. **View the Result:**
   - The program will display the player's choice, the computer's choice, and the result of the game.

6. **Play Again:**
   - To play again, simply run the game script (`python RockPaperScissor.py`) after the current game has ended.

## Example

```bash
Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): paper
You chose paper and computer chose scissors.
Scissors cuts paper! You lose.
```
